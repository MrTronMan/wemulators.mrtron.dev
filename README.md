# Welcome to Will's Emulator System!
A list of games using ROMs and EmulatorJS to emulate retro games.
the reason I am not using the normal emulatorjs site is, that this is just a simpler, mirrored version to access at school. (you also don't have to download roms for this, although there is an upload option)
As of now its only acessible to me @ <a href="http://wemulators-mrtron-dev.vercel.app/">the vercel app </a> and also <a href="http://wemulators.mrtron.dev">here.</a>
